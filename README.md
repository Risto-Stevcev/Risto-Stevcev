I'm working on:

- Simple, composable, declarative UI (compiler-free)
- Cross-platform UI toolkit, including TUI support 
- Logic programming tools to help with reasoning about a problem domain (expert systems, induction, abduction, deduction)
- Minimalistic, extendable, composable, auditable linux programs and programming tools ([Suckless](suckless.org/)-style, WM, terminal emulator, lock screen, dhcp, tar, base, plan9, etc)
- Web 3.0 tools (no blockchain)
- Monetizable mixed open/closed source models (zero trust, fully auditable)

Archived:

- O'Caml, Haskell and Purescript code. My interests have shifted to Prolog and Lisp (Common Lisp, Clojure, Fennel, Janet) for high level code, and Common Lisp with C + Rust for low level code.
- Callbag-html, to be replaced by a larger framework of tools I'm working on called Mycelium.
